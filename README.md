Public Procurement and Supply Chain Management on Blockchain
This project is an implementation of a public procurement and supply chain management system using blockchain technology. The system is designed to provide a transparent, secure, and decentralized platform for managing procurement and supply chain activities.

Features
Procurement process automation: The system automates the procurement process by providing a streamlined and transparent platform for stakeholders to collaborate and make informed decisions.

Supply chain management: The system tracks the movement of goods and services across the supply chain, providing stakeholders with real-time visibility into the status of orders, shipments, and inventory.

Decentralized platform: The system is built on a blockchain network, which provides a decentralized platform for stakeholders to interact and transact with each other, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

Immutable records: All transactions on the platform are recorded on the blockchain, providing a tamper-proof and auditable record of all activities.

Smart contracts: The system leverages smart contracts to automate processes, enforce business rules, and execute transactions automatically.

Technologies Used
Ethereum Blockchain: The system is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which provides a secure and decentralized platform for the implementation of smart contracts.

Solidity: The smart contracts are implemented using Solidity, which is a programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum network.

Web3.js: The frontend of the system is built using Web3.js, which is a JavaScript library that allows developers to interact with the Ethereum network.

Getting Started
To get started with the system, you will need to have the following tools installed:

Node.js
Truffle
Ganache
Metamask
